The Company will source and secure for the Client, property investment(s) aiming to meet the Criteria set out below agreed upon by the Client and the Company.

The Company will:
Provide property investment opportunities which aim to meet the Client’s Criteria, as outlined below
Case manage the client through the purchase of the property(ies)
Assist in any matters relating to refinancing the property(ies) should the Client choose to do so
We are committed to providing excellent service to all of our customers. Please read the following points carefully:
On signing this agreement and payment of the commitment fee, the Company will secure property investment
opportunities aiming to meet the agreed Target Criteria
All fees paid will be held in the Company Client Account until exchange of the property being purchased has taken
place.
For each property, the Company will provide an opportunity within 60 days, unless otherwise agreed. If failure to find a
property in this time a full refund is available (within 3-5 working days).
While every effort is made by the Company to obtain investment opportunities exactly meeting the Target Criteria, it is
ultimately the responsibility of the Client to choose to go ahead with a particular property. The Company does not
accept any liability if aspects of the Target Criteria are not met by an opportunity.

It is hereby agreed that in consideration of the Reservation Fee being paid to (the ‘Company’) shall procure
that the plot/unit(s)/property(ies) is reserved in the purchaser(s) name.
We ask that the purchaser updated the Company on any change of contact details in the future, in order to
maintain consistent communication.
